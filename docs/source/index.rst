BigJob is a light-weight Python package that provides a pilot-based job and data management system. BigJob's main focus is to be a flexible and extensible Pilot-based system for job submission and data management. Unlike many other Pilot-Job systems, BigJob natively supports MPI jobs and, because of its integration with saga-python_, works on a variety of backend systems (such as SGE, PBS, SLURM, clouds, etc).

More information can be found at BigJob_.
